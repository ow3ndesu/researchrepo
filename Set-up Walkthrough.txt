1. CHECK YOUR PHP, APACHE, MYSQL SERVERS IF IT IS ALREADY INSTALLED. IF IT IS, CHECK IF IT'S WORKING PROPERLY. LINK: https://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/files/XAMPP%20Windows/7.4.30/xampp-windows-x64-7.4.30-1-VC15-installer.exe/download
2. EXTRACT THE PROJECT 'librarymanagementsystem.zip' AND PUT IT IN YOUR 'xampp/htdocs' folder.
3. RUN APACHE AND MYSQL SERVERS.
4. OPEN BROWSER AND NAVIGATE TO 'localhost/phpmyadmin'
5. CREATE A DATABASE NAMED 'RRSdb'
6. IMPORT SQL FROM 'librarymanagementsystem/database/RRSdb.sql', THIS WILL POPULATE THE TABLES NEEDED FOR THIS PROJECT TO RUN
7. OPEN A NEW BROWSER TAB AND NAVIGATE TO 'localhost/librarymanagementsystem' OR IN YOUR DEFINED PROJECT ROOT

EVERYTHING SHOULD BE WORKING!
