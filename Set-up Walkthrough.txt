2. EXTRACT THE PROJECT 'researchrepo.zip' AND PUT IT IN YOUR 'xampp/htdocs' folder.
3. RUN APACHE AND MYSQL SERVERS.
4. OPEN BROWSER AND NAVIGATE TO 'localhost/phpmyadmin'
5. CREATE A DATABASE NAMED 'researchrepodb'
6. IMPORT SQL FROM 'researchrepo/database/sql/researchrepodb.sql', THIS WILL POPULATE THE TABLES NEEDED FOR THIS PROJECT TO RUN
